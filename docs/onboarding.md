# Jackson Lab Onboarding

Welcome to the Jackson Lab at Longwood University where we study comparative biomechanics - or the evolution of animal form and function regarding movement.

All lab data are stored in Box. You get free unlimited storage in Box. All projects and other resources for the lab are managed in software called Notion.

## To activate your Longwood Box account:

If youâ€™ve already activated your Longwood Box account for a class, you can skip this.

1. Go to [https://longwood.account.box.com/login](https://longwood.account.box.com/login)
2. Click continue. On the next standard Longwood login page, enter your lancerID and password (the same you use to sign in to Canvas)

## Keys

You will receive a key for Chichester 217. You are responsible for keeping this key safe, returning it at the end of the semester, and locking the door to keep the lab and the equipment secure. If you lose your key, you must notify Brandon immediately.
