# Lab 1: Blood

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 18 "The Cardiovascular System: Blood".

## Introduction

Blood, the only fluid connective tissue, consists of **plasma** and **formed elements**. While plasma is mostly water with some proteins and dissolved salts, formed elements debelop in the red bone marrow and include red blood cells **=RBC**, white blood cells, and platelets. Adult males have about 5-6 liters of blood and adult females 4-5 liters. A single drop of blood contains about 260 million red blood cells! This large number is necessary because red blood cells transport Oxygen (O₂ ) to each and every cell in the body. Blood also collects CO₂ and other waste products from the cells, transports nutrients (e.g. glucose), distribute hormones across the body and helps to regulate body temperature.

In order for you not to have to pierce yorself mutiple times, you might want to have different studts in your group act as subject for different experiments. 

## Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in RBCs responsible for transporting O₂ through the blood. Hb constitutes more than 95% of the non-water content inside RBCs. It has a quaternary protein structure consisting of four globular protein subunits. Each subunit contains an iron atom, which is the site of O₂ binding. When Hb binds O₂ its color is bright red (arterial blood). As O₂ is used in cells and little bound O₂ remains, the blood’s color is rather dark red (or blue if viewed through skin; venous blood). **The color of a blood sample can be used to measure the amount of Hb in the blood.** This quick and easy test is helpful to e.g. determine if a person suffers from **anemia** - a condition caused by a deficiency of red blood cells or of hemoglobin in the blood.

DIRECTIONS: 
When drawing small quantities of blood (a few drops), it is easiest and least painful to do so from the side of the fingertips. Have a paper towel handy to apply pressure against the skin after you obtain the samples for the tests you are performing. Open an alcohol prep pad and wipe the side of a lesser-used fingertip. Press the red tip of the safety lancet against the skin. The lancet will click as its internal needle penetrates the skin and retracts. Squeeze distally along the length of the finger to milk blood out of the wound. Wipe away the first blood that comes out with an alcohol pad. Once you have collected the necessary blood for each test, apply pressure against the wound with a paper towel to stop the bleeding.

To estimate Hb levels, soak a piece of chromatography paper with a drop of blood and allow it to dry. Next, compare the color of the blood spot to the Hemoglobin Color Scale to estimate the Hb content of the blood in g/dl. **Normal hemoglobin levels are 12-15 g/dl for women and 14-17 g/dl for men.** Could your subject be suffering from anemia?

## Hematocrit

 ![image](.\figures\Hematocrit.jpg)

Hematocrit is the percent of blood volume that is occupied by RBCs. It is also called PCV or packed cell volume - which hints at how you determine it. A centrifuge is used to spin a blood sample, causing the heavy RBCs to ’pack’ into the bottom end of the capillary, whereas the the light, clear plasma (water, solutes, and light plasma proteins) stay at the top end. White blood cells and platelets are ’heavier’ than plasma, but not as ’heavy’ as RBCs and thus stay in middle - visible as the so called **buffy coat**.

DIRECTIONS: 
Fill a heparinized (heparin is a chemical that prevents blood form coagulating) capillary tube with a sample of blood (the more you can fill the capillary, the easier it will be to read of the hematocrit and the more precise the test will work!). Plug the bottom of the tube with the white clay found at your bench. Bring the tube to the front of the lab. The instructor will place the tube into the centrifuge and tell you which position in the centrifuge it is in. Once everyone’s sample is in the centrifuge, we will spin the blood at **10,000 RPM for 5 minutes**. After the blood has been spun, find your tube and measure the hematocrit. **The hematocrit is the % of packed red blood cells compared to the entire capillary content** (RBCs, buffy coat, clear plasma). Use a sliding scale to read it! The scale either slides or spins so that the height of the blood sample in your tube can be lined up with the 100% marker on the scale. Normal hematocrit levels are 38% for women and 46% for men. Note your hematocrit. Is it within normal levels? How does it compare with the hemoglobin level you determined through the blood color?

![](.\figures\reading_hematocrit.jpg)

Read of the hematocrit at the top end of the packed RBC (in this example 50%). Note: some sliding scales are designed to rotate.

Reading the hematocrit by sliding it on the scale: Align the bottom end of the packed RBC with the 0% line and the top of the clear portion (the plasma) with the (angled) 100% line.

## Blood Sugar Levels

Besides the transport of gasses (e.g. O₂ and CO₂ ), blood also transports nutrients to the cells. Humans use the simple sugar **glucose** as the primary source of energy. Glucose is transported from the intestine or liver (where it is stored as glycogen) to all cells in the body to be ’burned’ by the mitochondria. The body uses the hormone insulin to regulate how much glucose is in the blood stream, the blood glucose level. A persistently low blood glucose level is called hypoglycemia. Persistently high levels are called hyperglycemia and characteristic for the disease *Diabetes mellitus*. Variations in blood sugar are normal over the course of the day, e.g. the blood sugar level quickly rises when we consume foods with a high *Glycemic Index* at lunch, however, after a few hours they should return to between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L (70 to 100 mg/dL).

DIRECTIONS: 
Insert a test strip into the blood glucose meter. This should turn the meter on. Once the meter has turned on and is ready for a blood sample, touch the test strip to your blood to draw some up onto the test strip. What is your blood glucose level? Did you recently eat or drink a soda?

## Blood Type

### RBCs and the Immune System

The Immune System is the body’s defense against bacteria, viruses, or any other substances that ’shoudn’t be’ inside the body. It distinguishes between the body’s own cells and intruders with the help of **surface antigens**. Specific **antigens** are attached your cell’s plasma membranes and your immune system, specifically the **antibodies**, recognize them and leaves these cells alone - just like you would used your student ID to show campus police that you belong here.

Like any other cell type, RBCs have surface antigens, too. This creates a problem when a patient needs a blood transfusion (blood is too complex to artificially synthesize, so modern medicine still relies on blood donors!): If antibodies in the recipient detect the ’wrong’ type of antigen, the patient’s immune system will attack the donor’s blood cells. There are a number of systems we use to ensure that blood is ’compatible’, i.e. the antigens and antibodies are similar enough between two individuals for their immune systems not to attack the other’s RBCs. Similar types of blood are grouped into blood groups, i.e. Type AB. The two most commonly grouping systems are the ABO and the Rhesus (Rh) system.

The **ABO** system distinguishes between four groups:

- Type A: cells with Antigen A and blood with with Antibody B (22.88% of population)

- Type: B: cells with Antigen B and blood with with Antibody A (32.26%)

- Type AB: cells with Antigen AB, blood has no Antibodies (7.74%)

- Type O or 0[^1]: cells have no Antigen, blood has Antibodies A and B (37.12%)

![](.\figures\Bloodtype_compatibility.png)

Table summarizing blood compatibility according to the AB0 and Rh systems. There is still the possibility that atypical antibodies are present that could cause an incompatibility.

As e.g. the cells of a person with blood type B have antigens of the type ’B’, but the blood doesn’t contain and ’B’ antibodies, so no immune reaction happens. Should this person, however, receive a blood donation from donor with blood type A, cells with antigen ’A’ are suddenly introduced and react with the ’A’ antibodies in the blood. When ’A’ antigens and antibodies encounter each other, they bind and neutralize (coagulate) the RBCs. Test yourself: Can a patient with blood type B receive blood from a donor with blood type AB? What about a donor with blood type 0? In transfusions individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients.  
The **Rhesus (Rh) system** just looks for presence of anti-D antibodies[^2]: if a patient does not have any she is Rh D-negative, if she does, she is Rh D-positive. If you don’t have anti-D antibodies (Rh-D negative), you can only receive blood donations from donors that are also Rh-negative. If you are Rh D-positive, it doesn’t matter.  

DIRECTIONS: 
Place a drop of simulated blood (which contains RBC with a subjects antigens) in each of the three wells of the plastic test slide. The instructor will provide a drop of anti-A, anti-B, and anti-Rh antibodies. Use a toothpick and gently mix the blood and the antibody solution. *Use a clean toothpick for each of the three wells to prevent cross-contamination of the antibodies!* Wait about a minute, gently rocking the test slide back and forth. Look for agglutination (formation of little clumps). If you see agglutination, you possess that antigen. Don’t wait too long - after 10-15 minutes all samples will look dried-in and agglutinated! What is your blood type?

### Blood type inheritance

What determines your blood type? Genetics - Antigen and Antibody types are inherited from your parents. Each parent contributes one of their two ABO alleles on chromosome 9. A parent with blood type AB can pass on either the A allele, or the B allele. If you inherit one O allele and one A (or B) allele, your blood type is A (or B). Thus, the only way for you to have blood type O is to inherit an O allele from your mother *and* your father. This test isn’t fail-safe: other blood groups than the ABO give misleading results and e.g. the Bombay phenotype and cis-AB lead to a type O child being born to an AB parent.

![](.\figures\bloodtype_inherit.png)

Table with possible combinations of blood type alleles. Due to the simplification of the blood type system, blood groups are only about 40% effective to rule out a man as a child’s potential father. Modern laboratory tests use genetic methods for a more reliable test.

### Hemolytic disease of newborns

As the father contributes one allele determining the fetuses blood type, it is possible for a fetus to have a blood type that is incompatible with that of the mother. The mother’s and fetus’s blood circulation are mostly separated by the placenta. If, however, the mother’s blood gets exposed to the fetuses’s blood (e.g. due to complications during pregnancy or at birth ), the mother’s immune system will form antibodies against the fetus’s RBCs. This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-D antibodies, the Rh blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of Rh disease. Modern medicine has developed Rho(D) immune globulin (trade name RhoGAM) which can prevent the formation of Anti-D antibodies by D negative mothers when given during pregnancy. Under what scenario could this affect you?

# Lab 2: The Heart - Anatomy

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 19.1 "The Cardiovascular System: Heart Anatomy".

## Introduction

The heart has a complex three dimensional structure that is very difficult to learn from a textbook or screen. It is far easier understood while dissecting it. We will be using pig hearts (or if not available, sheep hearts) that have been preserved in a fixative to prevent decay and make it easier to separate tissues. While this fixative does not contain formaldehyde, it is still advised to wear gloves and safety glasses - after all fixatives fix tissues including yours if you are note careful. Take your time dissecting! This lab is designed to leave you time to explore and not to rush you through the material. Compare what you see with your textbook and/or lecture notes. What are all these structures and how might they work? For many this will be the only opportunity in their life to actually see what the text books are trying to describe.

## Surface

If the pericardial sac is still intact, use a scalpel to detach the **parietal pericardium**. Carefully pull a little of the **serous membrane** from the myocardium and observe. Is there any **adipose tissue** (fat) visible on the heart surface? If yes, carefully scrape away while paying attention to the **coronary blood vessels** which supply the heart muscle with nutirtents and oxygen. There should be left and right coronary artery and the cardiac veins. What happens if one of them gets blocked by a blood clot?

Identify the **base** and **apex** of the heart. Identify the **auricles** - wrinkled pouch-like flaps protruding from the **atrial chambers** that increase their capacity. Next, identify the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. If the aorta has not been cut too close to the heart, you might see the **aortic arch** with the brachiocephalic, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries branching off.

## Atria

Cut through the aorta until you see **aortic semilunar valve**. Right above it you should be able to find the two openings to the **coronary arteries**; probe them! Turn the heart so that you look at its posterior surface (compare to a figure in a textbook if you are not sure what this should look like). There are four **pulmonary veins** entering the left atrium (on your left!) and the **inferior and superior venae cavae** entering the right atrium, but depending on where they were cut they might be very short. Where do they come from and what do they transport? Insert a probe in the superior vena cava and through the atrium on into the inferior vena cava. Using scissors, cut parallel to the probe to open up the atrium. Study the **tricuspid valve** and count the number of valve flaps. Is it the number you expected?

Identify the pulmonary trunk and cut through its anterior wall until you can see the **pulmonary semilunar valve**.

Continue the cut through the pulmonary trunk into the right ventricle. Then cut down, around, and up through the tricuspid valve to make the cut continuous with the cut you made across the right atrium. You should be able to spread the right atrium open to see a small opening just below the opening of the inferior vena cava: this is the coronary sinus which returns the venous coronary blood. Nearby in the interatrial septum is a depression. The is the remnant of the **foramen ovale**, an opening that passed blood from the right to the left atrium in the fetal heart.

## Ventricles

Now examine the opened **ventricular chamber**. Observe the fibrous **chordae tendineae** that attach e.g. on the ventricular side of the tricuspid valve. What do you think their function is? Try to move the valve flaps - how far can you move them in which direction?

Make a longitudinal incision through the left atrium and ventricle. Compare the thickness of the left and right ventricular **myocardium**. Why is the wall of the left ventricle so much thicker? Dissect down to the **mitral valve** and count the number of valve flaps. Do pig/sheep heart valves have the same "design" as the human valves shown in the text book? What are other differences?

Now that most of the heart is accessible, trace the blood flow through the heart starting at the vena cava. The heart is typically described as two side-by-side pumps. What are those pumps? Why do you have two pumps on not just one? Why do you need valves? When is the blood in the **systemic** and when in the **pulmunary circuit**?

## Cleanup

This concludes the ’guided tour’ through the heart, but please feel free to keep exploring to your heart’s content... For cleanup, please place the organic tissue in the provided black plastic bag (they need to be double bagged before they go in the trash!). Rinse the dissection tools and the dish in the sink and place them next to the sink on some paper towel for drying.

# Lab 3: The Heart - Physiology

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 19.2 "The Cardiovascular System: Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity".

## Introduction

Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) records the summated electrical activity of the heart muscle and enables us to diagnose may heart diseases, i.e. arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats), infarction (blocked coronary blood vessels), hyperkalemia (elevated levels of potassium), and many more. Plotting the electrical activity over time results in a characteristic waveform consisting of a P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave. Variations in this patter - e.g. the lack of a P-wave - indicate pathological condition - e.g. a problem with the heart’s SA-node pace maker.

### How the EKG works and what the PowerLab Data Acquisition Unit does

Modern electrocardiographs are complex machines that contain a computer and algorithms to automatically analyze the collected data. But even those machines are essentially just electronic amplifiers that measure the tiny electric fields generated by the electric charges moving across the heart muscle. These amplified signals are filtered and then displayed either on a screen or with a plotter on paper.

The PowerLab system contains the necessary amplifier and filter as well as a A/D (analog-to-digital) converter which translates the voltage fluctuations in a digital signal (a series of numbers) that the computer can plot.

### Navigating LabChart

LabChart is the software that allows you to control the PowerLab unit and display the acquired data. To effectively use the LabChart system you’ll need to learn how to use the software.  
DIRECTIONS: Please follow the Student Quick Reference Guide which can be downloaded here: https://www.adinstruments.com/support/downloads/student-quick-reference-guide

## Recording an ECG

### Electrodes and Leads

The simplest form of ECG uses 4 electrodes (one each at wrists and ankles) to measure the electric field across the heart from 3 different directions or ’leads’. These 3 directions are called the *limb leads* and they are traditionally labeled I, II, and III (see figure).

![](.\figures\EKG_leads.png)

The 12 leads and directions from which an ECG meassures the electrical activity of the heart. Lead I, II, and III are the limb leads and are present in the simplest ECG. The augmented limb leads aVF, aVL, and aVR are calculated. A 12-lead ECG additionally records the red vectors. (Source: Wikipedia)

From these three leads, 3 additional leads can be calculated: the three *augmented limb leads* traditionally labeled aVR, aVL, and aVF (augmented right, left, and foot). But even looking at the heart from 6 angles might not be enough to diagnose a specific problem. A cardiologist might add up to 6 additional electrodes (traditionally labeled V₁ through V₆) to bring the total to 10 electrodes and 12 different perspectives, an arrangement that is called the 12-lead EKG.

Which electrode goes where? While most modern ECG machines will tell you if an electrode is placed incorrectly, the 4 basic leads have a standardized colors and their placement is easy to remember: clouds (white right arm) over grass (green right leg), white on the right, and smoke (black left arm) over fire (red left leg).


DIRECTIONS: For this part lab we’ll follow the LabChart Human Physiology lesson *"ECG and Heart Sounds"* and fill out the provided data report sheet.

### Tips for getting a good ECG

A good ECG looks something like the graph below. Notice that the baseline is mostly level, and there are regularly spaced peaks arising from that baseline. Notice the P-waves, the QRS complex, and the T-waves. Notice that other than those waves, line is generally smooth. This is what the ECG should look like in the calibration step.

![](.\figures\ECG_new.png)

Example of a good ECG trace recorded in lab.

A "bad" ECG lacks those things. The three most common errors are inverted or different waves and complexes; a shifting baseline (looks like the peaks are on a rising or falling slope); or high frequency noise (lots of small waves covering these bigger waves of interest). The three most common causes of a "bad" ECG are *improper connections of wires* (wrong color to the wrong electrode on the body), *subject movement* (remember: muscle create electrical fields, too!), and *poor contact between the electrodes and the skin* (usually caused by the wires pulling at the electrodes or dried-in electrodes). Use kinesiology-tape if you can’t the electrodes to stick! At each step where you are asked to confirm the quality of your ECG following recording, if it is "bad", check those three things.

# Lab 4: Immune System (ELISA)

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered on this website: https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/experimental-techniques/enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay

## Introduction

ELISA - or Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbant Assay - is a common laboratory technique that e.g. allows to test a large number of patient for a specific infectious disease, e.g. HIV, Lyme Disease, Bird Flue, or West Nile. ELISA uses the presence (or absence) of disease specific antibodies in the patient’s blood as an indicator for the patient infection status.

## Immune Response

An virus entering the blood stream of a patient triggers a specific immune response: Proteins on the outside of the virus act as *antigens* as they bind to *antibodies* in the blood that recognize the antigen’s specific shape. There are five different classes of antibodies (also called immunoglobulins or Igs) which all facilitate the destruction and/of removal of the antigen carrying intruder. The majority of antibodies (80%) are of the Y-shaped IgG type that has two "variable segment" antigen binding sites as well as a "constant segment" binding site that can activate the complement system or bind to macrophages, basophils, or mast cells of the immune system.

![image](.\figures\ABs.png)



## How ELISA works

The ELISA techniques exploits the fact that a patient who has been exposed to a certain virus (or any antigen for that matter) will have an largely increased number of antibodies agains this antigen. In other words the diagnosis is indirect - by showing an increase in specific antibodies in a patient’s blood we can conclude that the patient was (recently) infected with the disease and his immune system fought it.


Showing the presents of antibodies in a patient’s blood works in steps:

1. bind an antigen specific to the disease you want to diagnose to the bottom of a plate-well

2. pipette the patient’s blood serum into well - IF the patient’s blood contains specific antibodies (AB) they will bind

3. wash non-bound serum away

4. pipette a secondary antibody specific agains the constant segment of human IgG into well - IF there sis human IgG bound, the secondary AB will bind

5. wash non-bound secondary AB away

6. the secondary AB is designed in such a way that the constant segment contains an enzyme

7. pipette chromogen into well - IF enzyme is present it will react the chromogen causing a color change from green to purple

# Lab 5: Organ Systems (fetal pig dissection)

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 1.2 "Structural Organization of the Human Body".

## Introduction

Now that we have worked our way through several organ systems in the body, it is time to revisit the internal anatomy through dissection. Since we do not have human cadavers, we will be using an anatomically closely related species to allow you to explore the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities as they pertain to the cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive and, to a lesser extent, integumentary and lymphatic systems. The internal anatomy of a pig is very similar in construction to a that of humans. Please remember that your pig was once a living organism and should be treated with respect and care.  

![](.\figures\Pig1.png)

External anatomy of a fetal pig.

- Examine the fetal pig and locate the external features shown in the image. 
- Locate the two rows of nipples of mammary glands which are present on the ventral abdominal surface of both males and females. Mammary glands later develop only in maturing females. 
- As we are looking at a fetal pig, there is an umbilical cord: Make a transverse cut through the umbilical cord and examine the cut end. Locate the two umbilical arteries that carry blood from the fetal pig to the placenta, and the single umbilical vein that delivers nutrient-rich blood back to the fetal pig. 
- *Determine the sex of your specimen*: The female pig has an urogenital opening immediately ventral to the anus and has a small genital papilla marking its location. The male pig shows a scrotal sac ventral to the anus and the urogenital opening is just posterior to the umbilical cord.

## External Anatomy: Upper Respiratory System

r0.6 ![image](.\figures\Pig2.png)

To expose the structures of the mouth and pharynx, start by inserting a pair of scissors in the corner of the mouth and cut posteriorly through the cheek. Open the mouth as you make your cut and follow the curvature of the tongue to avoid cutting the roof of the mouth.  
Hold down the *epiglottis* and surrounding tissue and continue your incision dorsal to it and on into the opening of the esophagus. Now, repeat the procedure on the other side so that the lower jaw can be pulled down to identify the following structures:

To see the remaining systems you need to dissect the pig. This diagram shows the correct order and location of incisions.

- Teeth (deciduous teeth may have erupted)
- Tongue - Papillae
- Hard and soft palate
- Nasopharynx
- Oropharynx
- Laryngopharynx

![](.\figures\Pig4.png)

In order to see the remaining systems, you will need to dissect your pig. PLEASE BE CAREFUL NOT TO INJURE YOURSELF! Make incisions along the lines shown in the figure above, but keep the cutting to a minimum: "to dissect" does not mean "to cut up", but rather "to expose to view"! If done right, your dissection should look like the one shown in the picture below. Use plenty of pins to spread the preparation open, then begin to identify the individual organ systems.

![](.\figures\Pig5.png)

Open thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavity, with major organ systems labeled.

## Thoracic Cavity

The thoracic cavity is protected by the rib cage and contains the pleural cavity containing the lungs as well as the mediastinum containing the heart. Note the 4 lobes of the lungs and how they hang relatively loose in the pleural cavity, mostly attached by the primary bronchi. As we are dissecting fetal pigs, the lungs were never inflated and are thus not fully developed.  
Locate and study:

- Trachea with cartilaginous rings (why does it have these rings?)
- Lungs (four lobes)
- Diaphragm

![](.\figures\Pig6.png)

As we are dissecting fetal pigs, the lungs were never inflated or functional. Many students are surprised by how small they are.

## Mediastinum of the thoracic cavity: the pericardial cavity

The pericardial cavity is surrounded by the pulmonary cavity to either side and contains the heart. Note how the heart is only attached at its base and can slide around (in order to properly see the heart you may need to remove parts of the thymus gland). Try to follow the blood vessels as well as you can. Open up the heart and try to compare it to the adult pig heart you previously dissected.  
Locate and study:

- pericardial sac
- inferior and superior vena cava
- pulmonary trunk and veins
- coronary blood vessels
- heart chambers

## Abdominopelvic Cavity

The abdominal cavity contains most of the digestive, the urinary, and the reproductive systems. The stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and spleen are held in place by the *mesentary* - double-folds of the peritoneum and since  2017 considered an organ! It provides mechanical stability, but also blood and lymph vessels, nerves, and storage for fat.  
Locate and study:

- Stomach
- Liver and hepatic portal vein
- Spleen
- Gall bladder and bile duct
- Pancreas
- Small intestine: Duodenum, Jejunum, Illeum
- Appendix
- Large intestine: Haustral pouches, Ascending colon, Transverse colon, Descending colon
- Kidney with renal artery and vein, and ureter
- Urinary bladder
- Reproductive organs: ovaries, uterus, vagina in female pig, testes (undescended in younger, in scrotum in older fetuses), prostate & bulbourethal gland in male pigs

![](.\figures\Pig8.png)

The abdominal cavity is often grouped with the pelvic cavity and referred as abdominopelvic cavity. Shown here is the lower part with the bladder labeled.

# Lab 6: Spirometry

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 22.3 "The Process of Breathing".

## Introduction

In this lab, you will investigate the volume of air that your lungs move as you breathe in and out. You will use a spirometer to directly measure air volume and also estimate lung volume and determine whether quick estimate agree with your direct measurements. By combining those measurements with the number of breaths you take per minute, you will figure out how much air moves in and out of your lungs over time. Finally, you will calculate the volume of oxygen (O₂) that you absorb and the volume of carbon dioxide (CO₂) that you produce. (note: 10 \* 0.1 liter = 10 \* 100ml = 1000ml = 1 liter)

## Measuring Respiratory Volumes

The most important respiratory volumes that are of interest to physiologists and health professionals are:

- Tidal Volume (TV)

- Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)

- Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)

- Vital capacity (VC)

Because you can consciously control your breathing, one can use a spirometer to measure the lung volumes described above. *Follow the instructions carefully, and repeat your measurements at least 3 times and average the values*.


DIRECTIONS: 
The subject using the spirometer should stand facing away from the gauge, holding his/her nostrils closed while exhaling. Make the following measurements and *record your values*. Use units of liters. (Note: 1 L = 1,000 mL)

- Tidal volume (TV): Inspire normally, then expire normally into the spirometer. The number on the gauge is your TV.

- Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV): Inspire maximally. Expire into the spirometer normally (do not force any air out). Record the volume shown on the gauge. This volume includes your TV, so subtract TV from this volume to get IRV.

- Expiratory reserve volume (ERV): Expire normally. Now, put the spirometer to your mouth and forcefully and completely expire the air that remains in your lungs. The number on the gauge is your ERV.

- Vital capacity (VC): Inspire maximally. Now, expire forcibly and completely into the spirometer.

| Subject | TV   | IRV  | ERV  | VC   | TV+IRV+ERV |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
|         |      |      |      |      |            |
|         |      |      |      |      |            |
|         |      |      |      |      |            |

## Estimating Vital Capacity

Directly measuring vital capacity can be a hassle. Also, VC is greatly influenced by how tall you are. For these reasons, physiologists often estimate VC using a person’s height: take the person’s height and multiply it by a conversion factor.

DIRECTIONS:

1. measure the subjects height (note: 1 inch = 2.54 cm = 25.4 mm)

2. Ladies: multiply your height (in cm) by 0.02 l/cm. 
   Gentlemen: multiply your height by 0.025 l/cm.

   Both: Record this value as *VC estimate 1*

3. Another way to estimate VC is to use a standardized chart. The chart provided in Figure 6.1 takes into account sex, height, and age. Look up the value and record it as *VC estimate 2.*

4. For comparison also *record the VC you measured* in the last section. How does it compare to the two estimates?



![](.\figures\VC_estimate.png)

Find your height (cm) and your age (years), then triangulate to find your estimated VC (mL). If your age falls between lines (e.g.: age 19), average the VC values of the ages above and below yours. Do the same if your height falls between lines.


| Subject | VC estimate method 1 | VC estimate method 2 | VC measured |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
|         |                      |                      |             |
|         |                      |                      |             |
|         |                      |                      |             |


<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## Lung Ventilation

You know how much air you move with each breath (TV), but how much air do you move over longer periods of time?

1.  Breathing rate: the number of breaths you take in one minute. While sitting quietly and watching a clock, count your breaths for one minute. Do this multiple times to get a more precise value. Record this value as “breathing rate”.

2.  Respiratory minute volume (RMV): the volume of air that you breath in one minute. Since you have determined your breathing rate and tidal volume, you can calculate your RMV and record it. RMV = Breathing Rate x TV Not all of the air that you breath actually makes it to the alveoli in your lungs where gas exchange takes place. For example, the last bit of air that you inhale only makes it to your trachea before getting exhaled. With each breath, some of your tidal volume occupies these anatomical dead spaces, the air spaces of your respiratory tubes. *Dead space is approximately 150 mL*.

3.  Pulmonary Ventilation (PV): the volume of air that actually reaches your alveoli. Calculate your PV and record it.

​	**PV = Breathing Rate * (TV - Dead Space)**

| Subject | Breathing Rate <br />[breath / min] | TV<br /> [L/breath] | RMV<br />[L/min] | PV<br />[L/min] |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
|         |                                     |                     |                  |                 |
|         |                                     |                     |                  |                 |
|         |                                     |                     |                  |                 |

You know how much air reaches your alveoli in a minute (PV). How much air do you respire . . .  
per hour? per day? per week? per year?

## Absorption and excretion of gases

You know how much air reaches your lungś alveoli each minute (PV), but how much Oxygen do you actually absorb into your body? Here is the percent amount of different gases in the air that enters your lungs and in the same air as it leaves your lungs.  

| gas  | inspired | expired |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| O<sub>2</sub>| 20.9 % | 15.8 % |
| CO<sub>2</sub>| 0.04 % | 4.0 % |
| N<sub>2</sub>| 79.0 % | 79.0 % |

  

Above table shows that the air that you inhale is 20.9% oxygen. When you exhale that same air, only 15.8% of your breath is oxygen. On the other hand, 0.04% of the air you inhale is carbon dioxide, and when you exhale that same air, 4.0% of it is carbon dioxide The human body does not consume or produce nitrogen, so the percent of the air you inhale vs. exhale that is nitrogen remains unchanged at 79.0%.  
You are locked in an airtight room that is 8 ft by 8 ft by 8 ft, i.e. has a volume of about 14’500 liter. Wow much oxygen is it this room?

Using the information in the table and your value for PV, how long would it take you to consume all the oxygen in the room (hint: first calculate how how much oxygen you *consume* with each breath, then calculate how much that is per minute and then divide the oxygen in the room by that number...). Carbon-dioxide is a major greenhouse gas - and you produce a little bit of it with every breath. How much? Using the information in the table and your value for PV to calculate how much CO₂ you produce through breathing every minute. Given an average life expectancy of 78 years , how many tons of carbon dioxide do you exhale over your life time? (hint: 1 liter CO₂ gas equals 0.0000018322003083900225 metric tons.... ).

# Lab 7: Carbohydrate Biochemistry

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 2.5 "Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning".

## Introduction

Today, you will be studying how carbohydrates are digested by the human body. Like most chemical reactions in your body, carbohydrate digestion is catalyzed by enzymes. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch. Amylase is produced by both your salivary glands (salivary amylase) and your pancreas (pancreatic amylase). *READ* and follow the instructions below *CAREFULLY*.

![image](.\figures\starch_to_glucose.png)

## Sample collection and preparation 

*Each member* of your lab group must collect a sample of saliva by carefully transferring saliva from mouth to a test tube. Collect at least one inch of saliva (not including any bubbles). This is your source of salivary amylase. 
The member of your group who has the least amount of saliva should boil his/her saliva over an open flame. ***CAREFUL: saliva bubbles VERY quickly when boiled.*** **Always wear eye protection and have the opening of the test tube pointing towards the wall**. Immediately remove from flame when it starts bubbling!  


DIRECTIONS: Obtain five test tubes and label them 1 - 5. Add the following to each test tube:

- Tube 1: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of saliva (contains salivary amylase!) + 1 mL distilled water

- Tube 2: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of saliva + 1 mL 5% HCl

- Tube 3: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of boiled saliva + 1 mL distilled water

- Tube 4: 3 mL starch + 1 mL of pancreatic amylase + 1 mL of distilled water

- Tube 5: 3 mL starch + 2 mL of distilled water

**Place the tubes in a warm water bath (37&deg;C)** **for about 20 minutes to allow time for digestion**. Vortex the test tubes every five minutes. 

Use this time to refresh how you analytically detect carbohydrates and form a hypothesis about which of the tubes will test positive for starch and which will test positive for monosaccharides.

## Identifying Carbohydrates: The Iodine Test for Starch

There are several simple diagnostic tests which allow the identification of different carbohydrates, the **Iodine Test** is used to identify carbohydrates in the form of starches. **When Iodine (yellow/orange in color) is added to a starch solution, a blue/black starch-Iodide complex is produced.**  

DIRECTIONS: 
After  the samples have been in the water bath for 20 minutes: Obtain a porcelain spotplate. Label five wells, one for each tube. To each spotplate well add about 4 drops from the test tube and one drop of iodine solution. Observe the colors. Which test tubes contained starch and why? Record your observations in the table.

| Test Tube # | Color | Is starch present? |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 1           |       |                    |
| 2           |       |                    |
| 3           |       |                    |
| 4           |       |                    |
| 5           |       |                    |



## Identifying Carbohydrates: Benedict’s Test for Monosaccharides and Reducing Disaccharides

Under suitable conditions chemicals with free aldehyde or ketone groups will transfer electrons to cupric ions (+2) to form cuprous ions (+1). Since all monosaccharides and most disaccharides can do this, they are called *reducing sugars* and their presence can be tested for by using various Copper solutions.

DIRECTIONS: 
After you tested for starch: Disregard all but  1mL of the solution from the test tube. Now, add  3 mL of reagent (Benedict’s) to each test tube. Mix well. Place the test tube into a boiling water bath for 3 minutes. Remove and let cool. The formation of a green or orange colored precipitate indicates a positive test. Note your observations in the table.

| Test Tube # | Color | Is starch present? |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 1           |       |                    |
| 2           |       |                    |
| 3           |       |                    |
| 4           |       |                    |
| 5           |       |                    |

## Food for thought:

- Why does a positive Benedict’s test first turn green and then orange?

- You added starch to EACH test tube. Which test tubes tested negative for the presence of starch after incubation? Why?

- Which test tubes still contained starch? Why?

- In the test tubes that were negative for starch, what product was formed?

- Which tube acted as a control?

- Why was it important to incubate the samples at 3737&deg;C?

# Lab 8: Diffusion and Osmosis

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 3.1 "The Cell Membrane".

## Introduction

Diffusion and osmosis are two processes that are essential for life to function. These processes are behind the movement of small particles, i.e. the molecules in your body, and understanding osmosis and diffusion allows you to predict in which direction and with which speed these particles will travel. Diffusion e.g. explains how oxygen gets to your cells so they can breathe and their mitochondria can make ATP. Osmosis explains why cells would ’explode’ if you were to accidentally grab a bag of distilled water instead a of a bag of saline for a transfusion. These processes are also absolute essential to understand e.g. how the kidney works.

Diffusion is slow... which makes this lab more challenging. Prepare all the dialysis tubing bags in the beginning of the lab as **it will take about 45 minutes before you re-measure the volumes and record the results**. Use this 45 break to form a hypothesis about what you will observe, understand the Silver Nitrate, Iodine, and Benedict tests and why you use them here, and do the Filtration exercise. Then go back and measure the dialysis tubing bags!

## Osmosis

Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Water moves down its own concentration gradient, moving from areas of low solute concentration (= high water concentration) to areas of high solute concentration (= low water concentration).

DIRECTIONS:

Prepare three dialysis tubing bags as follows:

Bag 1: Measure 15 mL of GLYCEROL into a dialysis tubing bag. Rinse the bag with distilled water to remove excess glycerol and then suspend it in a beaker of 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

Bag 2: Measure 15 mL of DISTILLED WATER into a dialysis tubing bag. Suspend the bag in a beaker of 200mL of GLYCEROL. (**Save this glycerol when finished - do not throw it away**)

Bag 3: Measure 15 mL of DISTILLED WATER into a dialysis tubing bag. Suspend the bag in a beaker containing 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

**Let all preparations sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 
Carefully measure the volume of each bag and record and explain your results in the table below.  

| Bag # | Start Volume | End Volume | Change | Explanation |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1     |              |            |        |             |
| 2     |              |            |        |             |
| 3     |              |            |        |             |

## Diffusion 

Simple diffusion is the movement of particles from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. In this case, we will be examining the movement of electrolytes, i.e. ions that have disassociated in water, and their ability to move along a concentration gradient and through a semi-permeable membrane.

### Silver Nitrate Test

In this experiment we are studying the movement of Chloride ions (Cl⁻). In this experiment we are studying the movement of Chloride ions (Cl⁻). chloride ions, we use Silver Nitrate (AgNO³) by simply adding a small drop of it to the solution being tested. If no Chloride ions are present, nothing will happen. If, however, Chloride ions are present, a white cloud will form.

DIRECTIONS:

1. Pour 15ml WATER into a test tube. Test water for CHLORINE using a few drops of AgNO3. Presence of chlorine will result in a cloudy appearance.

2. Measure 15 mL of NaCl (found on front bench) into a dialysis tubing bag. Rinse the bag and then suspend it in a beaker of 200 mL of DISTILLED WATER.

3. **Let the preparation sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

   Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 
   Carefully measure the volume of each bag and record and explain your results in the table below.  

| Chlorine @ 0 min | Chlorine @ 45 min | explanation |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|                  |                   |             |



### Food for though

Why do the instructions suggest to test the water in the tube for Chlorine? What is the chemical reaction behind the Silver Nitrate test, or in other words, what is the white cloud that forms in the presence of Chloride ions?

## Dialysis (a clinical application of diffusion)

The kidneys have important roles in maintaining health. When healthy, the kidneys maintain the body’s internal equilibrium of water and minerals (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfate). Those acidic metabolism end-products that the body cannot get rid of via respiration are also excreted through the kidneys. Dialysis is a process for removing waste and excess water from the blood, and is used primarily to provide an artificial replacement for lost kidney function in people with renal failure. Dialysis treatments replace some of the kidneys? functions through diffusion (waste removal) and ultrafiltration (fluid removal).

A semipermeable membrane is a thin layer of material that contains holes of various sizes, or pores. Smaller solutes and fluid pass through the membrane, but the membrane blocks the passage of larger substances (for example, red blood cells, large proteins). This replicates the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys, when the blood enters the kidneys and the larger substances are separated from the smaller ones in the glomerulus.

In this portion of the lab, we will observe the passage of **small molecules rather than large molecules through a semipermeable membrane, using starch and glucose as examples**. To analyze for the presents of starch we will use the Iodine test and for the presence of glucose the Benedict’s test:

###  Review of the Iodine (Starch) test

1. Put about 3mL (approx. 15drops) of deionized water and 1 dropper-full of Iodine reagent (I₂KI) into one test tube
2. Put about 3mL (approx. 15drops) of Starch/Glucose solution and 1 dropper-full of Iodine reagent (I₂KI) into a second test tube
3. A dark blue/black or green color indicates the presence of starch.

### Review of the Benedict’s (Glucose) test

1. Put 3mL (approx. 15drops) of deionized water and 3mL of Benedicts into one test tube
2. Put 3mL (approx. 15drops) of Starch/Glucose solution and 3mL of Benedict’s into a second test tube
3. Place both tubes in boiling water bath, using test tube holder, and let heat for approx. 5 minutes
4. After approx. 5 minutes, carefully remove tubes from water bath and place in test tube rack to cool.
5. If monosaccharides and/or disaccharides are present in the sample, a colored precipitate (solid material) will have formed. If the sample remains unchanged, the test is negative.



DIRECTIONS:

1. Fill a dialysis bag with 10-15mL starch-glucose solution. Suspend the bag in a beaker of distilled water.
2. Test a sample of the distilled water and starch-glucose solution for both glucose (Benedict’s test) and starch (Iodine test).
3. **Let the preparation sit for min. 45 minutes - diffusion takes time!**  

   Continue with the other experiments and come back to record the results later. 
   
4. Test the contents of the beaker for both starch (Iodine) and glucose (Benedict’s).
5. Test the contents of the bag for both starch (Iodine) and glucose (Benedict’s).
6. Record results below

|                    | t = 0 min | t = 45 min | explanation |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Starch in bag?     |           |            |             |
| Starch in beaker?  |           |            |             |
| Glucose in bag?    |           |            |             |
| Glucose in beaker? |           |            |             |



## Filtration

Several organs of the body, including the liver, lymph nodes, and kidneys are responsible for removing waste products from our blood and lymph via a process called filtration. Blood, lymph and waste products enter an organ and (mostly) clean blood and lymph exits. In this exercise, we will replicate that filtration process on a VERY simplistic level using water as our blood/lymph and Methylene Blue as our waste product. Charcoal will represent specific cells or proteins that our organs use to bind waste products and the filter paper is another representation of a semi-permeable membrane.


DIRECTIONS:

1. Take two test tubes and place 5 mL of distilled water into each.
2. Add 1 dropper-full of methylene blue to BOTH tubes and mix.
3. Add a pinch of activated charcoal to ONE tube and shake thoroughly.
4. Wait two minutes.
5. Pour each tube through a funnel lined with filter paper and collect the filtrate into clean test tubes. Describe the color of the filtrate in each tube and explain your results.

|                             | filtrate color | explanation |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Methylene Blue              |                |             |
| Methylene Blue and Charcoal |                |             |

The same principle is used to e.g. clean-up drinking water. Ever wondered what the little black specks are that you see when you insert a new Britta or PUR filter cartridge?

# Lab 9: Kidney and Urine Analysis

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 25 "The Urinary System"

## Introduction

A urinalysis (UA) is often performed by your physician as part of a routine medical exam to screen for early signs of disease. If you have signs of diabetes or kidney disease, to monitor you if you are being treated for these conditions, to check for blood in the urine, or to diagnose a urinary tract infection. A part of a urinalysis can be performed by using urine test strips, in which the test results can be read as color changes.

## Physiology


DIRECTIONS:

1. go to bathroom and urinate into a cup

2. make observations on physical characteristics

3. dip test strip into urine, blot excess with paper towel, and wait appropriate amount of time for results (see packaging)

4. record results on the table and compare to normal values 

| test             | expected result | your result |

Test strips provide a quick and cheap method to **screen** for medical conditions, they are, however, not suitable to **diagnose** (i.e. they are not reliable). A positive result on the test strip might indicate might indicate further diagnostic tests.

- **pH:** The acidity/alkalinity of urine. Abnormal pH levels can be associated with kidney stones, UTIs, or kidney disorders.
- **Specific Gravity**: Measures urine concentration. Abnormal levels can indicate conditions such as dehydration, kidney disorders, or inappropriate ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion.

- **Leukocytes**: The presence of white blood cells in urine might indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney infection.
- **Nitrites**: Bacteria that cause UTIs can convert nitrates into nitrites. A positive nitrite test can be an indicator of a UTI.
- **Urobilinogen**: Elevated levels can indicate liver diseases such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or conditions causing hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells).
- **Protein**: Protein in urine (proteinuria) can be a sign of kidney damage or disease, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions.
- **Blood**: The presence of blood can indicate kidney stones, UTIs, kidney injury, or bladder cancer.
- **Ketones**: The presence of ketones can indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes), starvation, or a carbohydrate-deficient diet.
- **Bilirubin**: The presence of bilirubin can suggest liver disease such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or bile duct obstruction.
- **Glucose**: Glucose in urine (glucosuria) can be a sign of diabetes mellitus or a condition leading to excessive blood sugar levels.

## Anatomy

What can you deduct from the anatomy of a kidney about how it works? What are the kidneys and what do they do? The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through two thin tubes of muscle called ureters, one on each side of the bladder. The bladder stores urine. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short. Assume you are the first scientist to try to figure out how the kidney does what it does: Filter blood and excrete the waste products as urine.

DIRECTIONS: 

1. Carefully dissect the kidney in front of you, paying close attention to texture and color differences. 
2. Make a sketch of the kidney that will help you to explain how the kidney works.

## Food for thought:

- Where does "dirty" blood enter the kidney?

- Where does "clean" blood leave the kidney?

- What is urine and where does it leave the kidney?

- What happens in the renal cortex?

- The medulla is the region located inward from the cortex. What happens here?


## Setup & supplies

**On each table**

- dissection dish with kidney

- dissection tools


**On side bench**

- gloves

- googles

- plastic cups

- URS10 test strips

# Lab 10: Metabolism - Caloric Budget

## Preparation for lab

To get the most out of this lab you need to be prepared. The basic knowledge needed for this lab is covered in "OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology" in Chapter 24.6 "Energy and Heat Balance" and 24.7 "Nutrition and Diet".

## Introduction

**This is a take-home lab, as you will record all you will record your energy intake (all you eat and drink), as well as your energy expenditure (all of your activity), over a 24 hour period to etablish a caloric budget. Read the compete instructions now and don't wait untl the last day to record the data!** 

**Metabolism** refers to the sum total of the chemical changes which occur in the body.  Energy can be measured in many ways.  The usual physiological unit of energy metabolism is the calorie.  A **calorie** is the amount of energy required to heat 1 mL of water by one degree Celsius.  This is a very small amount of energy, so physiologists measure energy in Calories (“big-C” calories).  A Calorie is one kilocalorie (1,000 “little-c” calories).  All caloric measurements in this class will be measured in Calories, and you’ll find that this is true of all reports on the energy content of food or energy burning of exercise.  The more energy your body can get from a food, the more Calories that food has.  The more exhausting some exercise is, the more Calories have been used.  

## Estimating the Basal Metabolic Rate (MBR) ##

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum expenditure of energy necessary to live.  It is expressed in terms of Calories burned per hour per body surface area (Cal / hr·m2). 

Calories per hour **is** metabolic rate.  However, depending on the shape and composition of your body, you may lose heat quickly or slowly.  Since humans maintain a stable internal body temperature, if you lose heat quickly you must generate more heat to stay alive, and this must be factored into any measurement of BMR.  

For example:  a tall, skinny person will lose heat much faster than a short, round person who weighs the same.  The tall, skinny person must burn more Calories per hour just to survive.  The amount of heat a person must generate in order to live – and therefore the amount of energy they must create – will not be the same from person to person.  

For this reason, BMR is measured as the Calories per hour you must generate per square meter of body surface (Cal / hr·m<sup>2</sup>). By standardizing metabolic rate to a given surface area (one m<sup>2</sup>), we can compare the metabolic rates of people of different body shapes, sizes, and compositions.  

The criteria for measuring BMR include 12 hours of fasting, 8 hours of sleep, minimal activity, and complete rest in the supine position.  Clearly, measuring BMR is very involved.  Because of this, physiologists often approximate BMR by measuring a person’s rate of Oxygen absorption.  This is known as **indirect calorimetry**. Oxygen consumption can be used to approximate BMR because it is known that the body uses one liter of Oxygen to generate about 4.825 Calories.  In the following exercise, you’ll use measurements of Oxygen absorption to estimate BMR.  

![](.\figures\Oxygen-Curve.PNG)

A subject breathes normally into a O<sub>2</sub> spirometer for 3 minutes with their nose closed off. The instruments has an oxygen sensor and records the amount of oxygen passing the sensor over time (see graph).  Note: the *trace is drifting upwards* during the 3 minute record! This means not all oxygen that enters the lungs also leaves the lungs - a part of the oxygen is absorbed by the body. 

DIRECTIONS

1. Pick either subject 1 or 2 and measure the **absorbed** amount of O<sub>2</sub>, the amount by which the curve drifts upwards within the shown 3 minutes.  

​	ending volume O<sub>2</sub> – initial volume O<sub>2</sub> =  _________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed during 3 minute trial

2. Divide the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed by the number of minutes of the trial (3) to get the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per minute.   

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per minute

3. Multiply by 60 minutes per hour to get the amount of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour   

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour

4. Because the amount of O<sub>2</sub> in the air varies depending on temperature and pressure, correct the volume of O<sub>2</sub> absorbed per hour to standard temperature and pressure (STP) by multiplying by a correction factor.  Given room temperature and our altitude, use a correction factor of 0.9.

​	_________ liters O<sub>2</sub> per hour at STP

5. Multiply this number by 4.825 to convert liters of absorbed O<sub>2</sub> per hour to Calories burned per hour.

​	_________ Calories burned per hour

6. Using the subject’s height and weight, determine the subject’s body surface area using the nomogram below. To use a nomogram, find the height on the left scale and the weight on the right scale. Draw a line between those two points and read of the surface area on the middle scale.

​	body surface area  =  _________ m<sup>2</sup>

7. Determine BMR by dividing Calories burned per hour by body surface area.

​	BMR =  _________ Calories / hr·m<sup>2</sup>

![](.\figures\Nomogram.PNG)



The BMR you just calculated from the provided measurements is a good estimate of this subjects BRM. There are, however,  faster ways to get to an estimate, e.g. a table like this:

| Age Range | Female | Male  |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| 18-19     | 38.85  | 43.32 |
| 20-21     | 38.30  | 41.43 |
| 22-23     | 37.60  | 40.82 |
| 24-27     | 36.74  | 40.24 |

How does your (complicated, measurement-based) estimate compare to the estimate provided by the table?

Why is the BR of males higher than that of females? 

Why is the BR of younger people higher than that of older people? 



## Caloric Budget: Intake and Expenditure

Over a period of 24 hours, record every food you eat (Caloric intake) and journal what you do with 15 minute precision (Caloric expenditure) - this includes *all* activities, incl. e.g. sleeping. You can use the Caloric Worksheet provided on CANVAS to record your data, or simply use a blank sheet of paper or your phone.

Once you have the data, we need to convert it.

DIRECTIONS

1. Look up with how many calories the food you ate provided your body with. You can either look at the nutrition facts label, or use a website (e.g. Google will tell you!)

   Example: you recorded eating one banana at 9am, so write down 105 calories intake

2. The energy needed to perform a physical activity is often expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs).  METs correlate your rate of energy expenditure to your resting metabolic rate.  By definition, 1 MET is the energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour when sitting quietly.  Sleep has a MET value of 0.9 Calories per kilogram per hour.  Heavy exercise may have a MET value in the teens.  
   Convert the activities you recorded into MET, using the "Compendium of Physical Activities" posted on CANVAS, or a website (e.g. https://golf.procon.org/met-values-for-800-activities/). 
   Multiply how long you did the activity (in hours) with the MET factor you looked up and then with your bodyweight in Kg. This tells you how many calories you expended on that activity.

   Example: you recorded studying from 8am until noon (4 hours), so write down 4 hrs x 1.3 * 64 Kg = 332.8 cal expediture

3. Add up all the the intakes and, separately, all the expenditures you recorded over the 24 hour period.

4. Substract the intake from the expenditure - based just on your caloric intake and expenditure, were you losing or gaining over the 24 hour period?  

5. Let's assume person takes in 2000 calories per day, but expands 2300. Knowing that **one pound of body fat equals 3500 Calories** and assuming that every day is the same, how many days would it take for this person to lose 5 pounds? (The realty is more complex, but let's just keep it simple for this example...)

6. Assume this person's caloric intake and expenditure are perfectly equal, but she decides begin going to Starbucks every day and buying a grande-peppermint-white-chocolate-mocha-no foam-with sprinkles and drink the whole thing.  To cut back on Calories, you have it made with nonfat milk and without whipped cream.  According to Starbucks’ website, this drink contains 430 Calories.  How many days will it take to gain 5 pounds?
