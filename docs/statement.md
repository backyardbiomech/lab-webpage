# Statement on lab culture and expectations

 > *This statement describes lab culture and expectations (both the ones that I have of you and the ones that you can have of me). Like a course syllabus, it describes the bigger picture aspects of how the lab functions regarding mentoring, other human aspects, and expectations. Details on how to do specific things in the labs can be found on specific project pages as "Procedures". The highlighed parts or those that I believe are more ‚Äúunique‚Äù to our lab or that I consider particularly important; you might want to read these parts extra carefully. I have incorporated great ideas from lab members and other labs. This document will always be in progress and feedback is welcome.*

## The lab community

### Lab culture

- We strive for a welcoming space where people can bring their whole selves to work. Everyone in the lab should be kind, respectful, and actively supportive of each other.
- The work we do in the lab is independent but collective. We never compete with each other, but we try to lift each other up. This is a good attitude in the broader scientific community, and generally demonstrated in the field of comparative biomechanics.
- I expect everyone to participate in the lab‚Äôs, department's, and university's academic events (i.e., lab meeting, interest group meetings, external presentations by lab members, scientific presentations on campus by other researchers) to the best of their ability. Participation is not just attending but also paying attention, asking questions, and commenting - even if the topic is not directly related to your interests or project.
- Show interest in and learn about your lab colleagues‚Äô work. This can be done informally, such as stopping by while someone is working and asking them what they are up to, or asking someone to coffee or lunch (I will always be happy to buy you lunch ü•™ and talk about research - you can just ask for a lunch research meeting and I will buy lunch, no questions asked). These discussions benefit all parties involved.
- I expect you to work largely independently. Work your own hours. Try to solve your own problems. Find and read papers on your own. Make mistakes and learn from them. When you hit a roadblock you can't get around, don't hesitate let me know. **Independent is not alone**.
- I value open and direct communication. Please feel free to disagree with me at any time, and to bring up when you think that things I do are problematic.

### Social events

- Other than coffee and lunch (see above), socializing with lab members and the larger scientific community is an important part of sciencing. If the department has an ice-cream social, or a science related student-group is holding an event that's open to you, then try to go. Talk about your project, ask other's about what they are doing, and count it towards your research hours.
- Feel free to suggest some event yourself, and organize it. Is there an event at a museum in Richmond, D.C., or at Virginia Tech? Want to go to the zoo with a group? Let me know! We might be able to get funding and even a car to cover transportation.

### Work-life balance

- Working independently makes it difficult to know when you stop working. Very important: I expect you **to not work all the time**. It is important to sleep and rest enough, take breaks during the day, take long weekends, manage family responsibilities, have hobbies, and have a social life. Doing science should never be at the expense of everything else. Make sure that your research and your classes are not detrimental to your physical or mental health.
- Work hours are flexible and you are responsible for organizing your time such that your work gets done, but I can help you think about the organization.
- You are generally expected to be available for meetings scheduled in regular work hours, but exceptions will be respected.
- You are not expected to work or respond during evenings or weekends; however, right before external deadlines (such as for conferences or grants), I might ask you to make an exception.
    - I am often available by text message or email evenings and weekends if you need help.
- As a lab, we highly value being active beyond our scientific work to improve the local or broader academic community, to communicate science to the general public, and to use science to help shape policy. I participate in many such activities myself, I encourage you to consider participating in such activities, and I am always happy to talk about them.

### My weaknesses

I recognize certain weaknesses in myself that I am trying to work on and that might be useful for you to be aware of. You can help me improve by giving me feedback.

- I often set unrealistic timelines for projects (thinking things will take less time than they actually take), which can be very frustrating for others. Please let me know when you think this might be happening, so that we can set more realistic timelines.
- I don't give much positive feedback out loud (but I'm trying to get better). I have a tendency to focus on next steps and what can be improved in a project. If I don't say much, don't assume that I'm not happy with something. If I'm quiet, and you need to know what I think, please just ask rather than assume.
- I don't have (but I'm working on) a workflow for turning items from a discussion into my own actions. If you need me to do something specific (e.g., write a recommendation letter, send a piece of code), email me. I have a very good workflow for getting through emails that tell me to do things. And please don't be afraid to send me as many reminder emails as you need!
- I have a tendency to ramble. I prefer to call this "brainstorming", or "thinking out loud". If I'm doing that, and you need to get to class, go get some food, get back to your project, or just don't have the energy listen to me anymore, please interrupt me.

### No-guilt policy

When you feel you don‚Äôt meet expectations (society's, someone else‚Äôs, or your own), it is easy to feel guilty. Sometimes, people fall into a vicious cycle of feeling guilty, avoiding the work that makes them feel guilty, getting less done, and feeling more guilty. This happened to me in college, in graduate school, and occasionally still happens now. As much as possible, we will enact a no-guilt policy: we will do everything we can to reduce the chances of you feeling guilty, and if you do feel guilty, we will talk about the underlying causes. Why didn‚Äôt you manage to do everything that you wanted to do: were my or your own expectations too high/unrealistic? Did you have personal circumstances? Did you simply need a break? Are you struggling with procrastination (like me), and if so, what can we potenially do together to help with that? (E.g. daily 5-minute meetings, working-together arrangements.) Some potentially helpful resources on the topic of guilt:

- [Susan Krauss Whitbourne (2012), The definitive guide to guilt](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201208/the-definitive-guide-guilt)
- [Edward Kubany and Susan Watson (2003), Guilt: elaboration of a multidimensional model](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward-Kubany-2/publication/265408861_Guilt_Elaboration_of_a_multidimensional_model/links/54b80ec50cf269d8cbf6c4f1/Guilt-Elaboration-of-a-multidimensional-model.pdf)

Speaking of procrastination, I realized in myself (after a lot of self-reflection) that my procrastination stemmed from a fear of starting something, investing time and energy, and then having it not work out. It was fear of "failure". I got over that by a simple (but difficult) change in mindset: When I need to start something new (a project, a piece of computer code, a paper, etc), rather than starting with the full thing in mind, I start with the smallest part I can imagine: the hypothesis, the import statements, the title. Then the next small part. 

# The flow of work

To get the full benefits of being a member of the lab, you are expected to take at least one research credit every semester you are in the lab (exceptions must be discussed and agreed to prior to the start of the relevant semester).

- It is your responsibility to fill out the Research Contract and send it to me before the start of each semester (I have to edit and submit it several days before the end of add/drop).
- After every two credits, I expect you to present your work (even in-progress) in some form at the research showcase on campus.
- After three credits, I will do everything I can to support your travel to a state-wide or national conference (usually the Annual Meeting of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology - [www.sicg.org](http://www.sicb.org)), though you will need to apply for travel funding from the University.
- After three or more credits, depending on the project, we will try to complete your results for publication.

You should keep track of your hours you spend on your research using whatever methods you want.

### Meetings

- Individual meetings have many purposes. In a meeting, we discuss how the project is going, but also how you are doing personally. The work part will often take the form of you presenting new code, data, videos, or results in figure form. But there are many reasons why you might have no new "stuff" since the previous meeting - e.g. you didn‚Äôt feel well, you were struggling with debugging your code, or you didn‚Äôt feel motivated. That is ok. We can talk about any difficulties in the meeting if you want, and I will not judge you.
- We will try to have a quick (30 minutes or less) "to-do" lab meeting once per week. This is a chance for all lab members to hear what other lab members are working on. Each person should expect to present:
    1. What they said they would accomplish at the last meeting
    2. What they accomplished, and why it's different than #1
        1. this can include finding a reading a paper that might be of interest to the lab in general
    3. Any roadblocks, hurdles, difficulties they are running into
    4. Any specific thing they need from other lab members (including me)
    5. What they will accomplish before the next meeting
- Meetings can be short! In fact, shorter meetings are generally better.
- Depending on the part of the semester, and the stage of the projects, and everyone's schedules, we will try to read and discuss one paper every two weeks after those "to-do" meetings.
- I am also happy to set regular weekly meetings with individual students as requested.

### Project progress

- In all projects, I will provide high-level supervision: my views on why we are doing the project, where we are heading, and how we get there.
- At the start of your project, I will help with the small details of the project.
- As you have been part of the lab for longer, and worked on your project for longer, you are expected to gradually take ownership of your project and see it through to completion or to well-considered abandonment.
- Be prepared that full projects, from first data collection to a conference presentation or a publication, can take a long time, with 2-3 years being typical. If you can't spend that much time in the lab (or you join the lab later in your college career), please adjust your expectations regarding outcomes. See above regarding credits and presentations.

### Dealing with mistakes

- Despite our best efforts, mistakes happen and we have to be open about them.
- If you've discovered a mistake I made, please tell me about it. If you've made a mistake that set you back, please tell me about it. Making mistakes, reflecting on them, and figuring out how to avoid the same mistake in the future is **the most important skill you will learn.**

### Collaborations

- Collaboration within the lab is strongly encouraged. This can sometimes be in the form of extended consultation of each other‚Äôs projects, and sometimes a formal collaboration. Often, a new student will be co-supervised by a more senior student. I also strongly encourage you to think about explicit connections with the projects of your lab colleagues, and even students in other labs; this is a low-threshold way to take a broader perspective of your own project.
- Using lab resources, including your project and data, as part of a project for a class is a form of "collaboration." You are welcome to propose new collaborations, and use your project in other classes, but discuss them with me (and other professors involved) before you start them.

### Finishing projects

- Authorship on papers and presentations is usually obvious, but the grey area is when smaller contributions warrant authorship. I expect that all authors contribute to the ideas in a project. As a concrete proxy for such contributions, I expect that for a lab member to be an author, they attend (and speak in) the project meetings from the moment they are brought onto the project.
    - [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) is a system for recognizing contributions to a paper, and we can use it as a guide to discuss authorship. For lab members, you must significantly contribute in three or more of the following to be considered for authorship: conceptualization, data collection, formal data analysis, methodology, writing
    - If someone ‚Äúonly‚Äù assists with data collection without a broader intellectual input, then that is usually an acknowledgement in the paper, not authorship.
- When a project is finished can be a difficult question, and it depends on the scientific question, other publications, and what journal we are aiming for. I will discuss this with you on a case-by-case basis, and you are welcome to bring it up yourself.

# Professional development

### Mentoring others

I usually assign incoming students during their first semester in the lab to a senior student's project.  Mentoring others is useful in many ways: often, you understand something better when you explain it to someone else; later in your career, you will often have to mentor, so it is good to get practice; mentoring practices listening to others and putting yourself in their shoes, which makes you a better collaborator (and human being). 

- If you formally mentor someone in **their** project, you may qualify to be a co-author on papers and presentations that come out of that project. I commit to giving you guidance on how to develop as a mentor. You are never obligated to mentor others on their projects, but I would strongly encourage it.

### Seminars etc.

There are several seminars, talks, and paper discussions, and events that will help you feel part of the broader academic community and give you a bigger perspective. I expect you to attend all department and university events (scientific talks, job candidate talks) and as much as you can of the student research showcase, schedule permitting, even if the biological topic is not related to your interests or projects.

- Note that the chemistry, math, psychology, kinesiology, and computer science departments may also have talks or events on somewhat related topics.
- Any such event you attend counts towards your research credit hours, as long as you aren't getting credit for another class for attending

### Growing up in Science

If you want to explore the human side of doing science more, you might want to check out the [Growing up in Science](http://www.growingupinscience.org/) series. In each event, one faculty member shares their life story, with a focus on struggles, failures, doubts, detours, and weaknesses. Common topics include dealing with expectations (your own and others), impostor syndrome, procrastination, the role of luck, rejection, and conflicts with advisors, but these topics are always embedded in the speaker's broader narrative. We also feature speakers who have left academia - e.g. academic editors, data scientists, and even a screenwriter. The series has themed events on mentorship, anti-racism, work-life balance, and other topics. Growing up in Science has many videos of past events on its [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIzTiEODRtQWX6zEu_Y3fA/playlists).

### Your next career stage

You can expect me to help prepare you for your next career stage. Talk to me early and often about your next steps; this can already start the moment you join the lab. I can help you think about career paths and introduce you to others to talk to. Once it is time to take concrete steps, I will write a recommendation letter, discuss with you the application, interview, and negotiation process for your next position (especially if it is academic), listen to and give feedback on practice talks, and give feedback on written statements. I will also provide you with resources, such as Research or Personal Statements by previous lab members who applied for graduate programs (shared with their permission, of course).

### Leaving the lab

For many reasons, you might consider leaving the lab. Maybe this type of research is not what you are looking for, maybe you only needed one credit, maybe your interests have changed, or maybe you don‚Äôt like the lab culture. Don‚Äôt keep this to yourself but discuss it with me. I will not take it personally and I will do my best to help you find another lab, if that's what you want. 

### Lifelong mentorship

My role as a mentor does not end the moment you leave the lab or the University. I hope you  always feel free to ask me for advice or just let me know how you are doing, and where you are in life. I am still in regular touch with my own past mentors. As you move on, you will also become an invaluable resource for my future students!
